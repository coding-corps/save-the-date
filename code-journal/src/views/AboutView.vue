          I've always been more of a hands-on learner; even if I read all the
          available literature and theory, unless I put it into practice, I'll
          never be able to truly understand the concept.

          This page will serve as a journal, to keep track of the things I
          discover as I progress in my development journey; as a byproduct, this
          page will perpetually change and evolve along with me.
